*********TestNG**********
TestNG is a testing tool that helps us to structure our test cases using different annotations

Benefits of TestNG:
1.Reports
2.Annotations e.g. @Test, @before, @beforeclass
3.Parallel testing
4.Batch execution
5.Assertions  -  Hard Assertions ,Soft Assertions
6.Data Parameterizaiton

it can be integrated with cucumber , maven and selenium

1.Annotations:
we do not need any main method
annotation is a tag that provides additional information about class,interface or method in TestNG

@Test
@BeforeMethod
@AfterMethod
@BeforeClass
@AfterClass

1.@Test
You should write your test cases under this annotation.
This is the main annotation in TestNG
By default testNG executes the methods in alphabetical order.(method names)

2.@BeforeMethod
Runs every time before the @Test is executed
also called precondition

3.@AfterMethod
Runs every time after the @Test is executed
also called post condition

bbefore method is precondition that must run before every test case and the post condition will
run after the test case has ended

priority:
by default the priority is zero of all the test case
in order to give them a priority order
use @Test(priority = 1)

Enabled & Disabled
@Test(enabled=false) --> will not run the test cases that are set false
by default all test cases are set to enabled = true

DependsOn
@Test(dependsOnMethods = "methodName")
will only run if the dependent method has passed successfully else it will be skipped

HardAssertions:
we have hardAssertions in testNG
in order to use the assertion we use

Assert.assertiontype()

Assert.assertEquals(text,expectedText);
it passes if text equals expectedText it fails if not!

Assert.assertTrue(boolean variable)
This assertion check state of the boolean variable
it passes if the boolean is true
it fails if the boolean is false

In hard assertions if we have multiple assertions
as soon as one of them fails it quits checking other assertions and declared the test case has failed

SoftAssertions:
SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();
we should declare it first!!
soft assertion continue to check all the assertions regardless of the fact even if one or more assertions
have failed, which is not the scenario in case of Hard Assertions(they stop execution whenever one assertion fails)

in order to use soft assertion***-->
    1. Decleration:
    SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();
    softAssert. softAssert.assertTrue(displayed);
    softAssert.assertEquals(text,expectedText);

    2.at the end you must do
    softAssert.assertAll();

    ***note***
    After the decleration when u use soft.assert it just checks the assertion but does not take any action or display any output
    once all the assertion are done
    then u use soft.assertall() to compile the result of all the assertion and show you the results on screen
