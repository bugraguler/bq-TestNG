*********TestNG - 03**********

TestNG XML?
helps us to control ezecution of the test cases!!!

<suite>
        <test>
                <classes>
                <packages>            <class name ="class name"/>

                            <class name ="class name">
                                                    <methods>
                                                            <include name = "method name"/>
                                                    </methods>
                            </class>
                <packages>
                            <package name ="name of package">
                </packages>
                </classes>
        </test>
</suite>

**when we run a specific method from a class, if it has any before and after method they will also be executed even if we do not
select them to run

**executing our test cases on group level

**when we execute in our XML using groups by default the @beforeMethod and @afterMethod WILL NOT EXECUTE
ONLY methods tagged with that tag wil be executed

In order to deal with this problem, because if we have any @beforeMehod where we are doing some initialization we use
the following method
i.e
@AfterMethod(alwaysRun = true)
whenever you are running by groupd and u get an error NULLPOİNTEREXCEPTİON
the first thing to check is.....
"@beforeMethod and  @AfterMethod(alwaysRun = true)"

--------------------------

Listeners:

Listeners class listen to events like test failed/pass/skipped etc.
once the testcase has executed
and it either fails /pass/skips
depending upon the status
listeners class takes you to the execution of the code that you have written for the scenarios
if your test case fails /pass or skips

Implementation of listeners class:

Listeners class implements ITestListeners
which is an interface from TestNg
and we override to methods according to our need

after that you need to link the listeners class to the class on which you want it to listen
that can ber done using TestNG.XML

u define your<listeners> tag just under <suite> and then write down the classes u want it to listen to.

--------------------------

DataProvider in TestNG:
Data provider is used for datat driven testing.
Use data provider for small data sets for greater one use excel

if we want to declare our data set it must be under @DataProvider(name = "name it please")

if we want our test case to utulize this dataprovider
what do we need to do?
we need to write the tag and the name of data provider near @Test
e.g. @Test(dataProvider = "Credentials")
